										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the world is thrust amidst a deadly pandemic called Coronavirus and the danger is real.</p>



<p>There are actually types of <strong>Coronavirus, COVID-19</strong> being the most recent and the deadliest one. According to researchers, when a person infected with the virus coughs or sneezes, the droplets released in the air can infect another. This is why social distancing is mandatory to stop the spread of the disease. It approximately takes 14 days for the symptoms to appear once infected and the symptoms that occur include;</p>



<ul><li>Cough</li><li>Fever</li><li>Muscle ache</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Sore Throat</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Headache</li><li>Kidney failure and severe respiratory problems in rare cases</li></ul>



<p>However, there is still no cure and spraying alcohol or chlorine all over the body isn’t helpful says the World Health Organization. But that being said, the virus is serious and people are losing their lives because of it. Therefore, it is important to wash or sanitize your hands frequently, embrace social distancing and <strong>stay safe at home.</strong></p>



<p>To further delve into the matter, it was reported by PUBMED that if the pH of your blood is 7.34, then you are almost safe. But for most of us, the pH of our blood is lesser than the said figure. And, one of the main reasons for this is we mostly consume RO water with a pH below 5.5, which is acidic and polluted. So, what is the solution?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vyom-alkaline-water-machine.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-623" srcset="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vyom-alkaline-water-machine.jpg 550w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vyom-alkaline-water-machine-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vyom-alkaline-water-machine-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vyom-alkaline-water-machine-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vyom’s <a href="https://vyominnovation.com/alkaline-water-ionizer/"><strong>Alkaline Water Ionizer</strong></a> ensures that you consume water above  8.5 pH and comes with several beneficial minerals to help enhance your immune system, which is an important aspect when it comes to fighting <strong>Coronavirus</strong>. Vyom’s alkaline water is not acidic unlike your regular tap or RO water and comes with alkaline minerals and negative oxidation-reduction properties. The other benefits of consuming Alkaline Water from Vyom include;</p>



<ul><li>Hydration</li><li>Enhanced immunity</li><li>Reduction of acidic content from our gut</li><li>Healthy bones because of minerals such as magnesium and calcium.</li></ul>



<p>Of course, drinking alkaline water alone will not solve the problem. Apart from this, we must follow all the precautions religiously. And, it is also important that you follow the below-mentioned tips.</p>



<ul><li>It is also extremely that we keep our living quarters sanitized. Make sure you use phenol or other disinfecting products to clean your home regularly. &nbsp;Right from furniture to floors, rigorous cleaning is a must.</li><li>Use Dettol or other disinfectants while washing your clothes.</li><li>&nbsp;Remove your masks and gloves before you enter your house and use fresh ones every time.</li><li>If you have pets, make sure you sanitize them before they enter the home after their walk.</li><li>Wash fruits and veggies thoroughly.</li><li>Sanitize the food packets before you bring them in.</li><li>Finally, keep your calm. Panicking is not a solution and make sure you take care of the elderly living close by because this is a crisis for all. We are all in this together and we will even overcome this together.</li></ul>

So, knowing the difference becomes mandatory to keep yourself healthy. But don’t worry; we are here to help you out. Take a look at the proper ways to store fruits and veggies to keep them fresh longer.</p>



<p><strong>Green leafy vegetables</strong></p>

<p><strong>Asparagus</strong></p>



<p>Asparagus must always be stored in a refrigerator. Why? Because it ensures that the stalks stay moist. So, to do that wash them nicely and wrap them in a damp towel or even paper would do. Now, take a glass of cold water and place the stalks in the glass and refrigerate them. In Vyom’s 4 door refrigerator<strong>, </strong>you can easily segregate your products and store them as required to keep them fresh longer.</p>



<p><strong>Tomatoes</strong></p>



<p>Keep only ripe tomatoes in the fridge. You can easily store them in Vyom’s vegetable crate. Otherwise, store them at room temperature and make sure that you keep them away from the sunlight. To ensure that your food tastes fresh longer, apart from storing it correctly, you must also make sure that you make use of only the top fridge brands in India<strong>, </strong>such as Vyom.</p>



<p><strong>Freezing your veggies</strong></p>



<p>During summers, you can always freeze your veggies to keep them nutritious and fresh for longer. You can even cut your veggies and put them in ziplock covers for easy access. Vyom’s <a href="https://vyominnovation.com/refrigerator/"><strong>multi-door refrigerator</strong></a><strong> </strong>has a large freezer to help you store and meal prep your food. This method is especially useful for working professionals, who are always in a hurry.</p>



<p>However, you cannot simply cut and store them. To make sure you stock your food the right way in Vyom’s multi-door refrigerator<strong>, </strong>follow these below steps.</p>



<ul><li>First, wash your veggies and either cut them or use them as a whole.</li><li>Boil water and add your vegetables to blanch them but for a minute or two, that’s it. Then immediately take them off the water and transfer them in a bowl of ice-cold water. Did you know?&nbsp; Frozen vegetables can be used for months. So, all the hard work will make cooking easier.</li><li>Don’t freeze eggplant, lettuce, sprouts, potato, and sweet potato.</li></ul>

<p>You
have probably heard it from a friend or maybe seen ads of the same, but there
is no denying the fact that alkaline water is quite popular today. While some
say it can slow down the aging process, some say it can also prevent cancer.
So, what is it? Is alkaline water some sort of a magical tonic? Is the hype
truly worth it? Keep reading to know all about it.</p>



<p><strong>What is alkaline water?</strong></p>



<p>When
we say water is alkaline, we are talking about its pH levels. Now for instance,
if the pH level is 1, it means it is extremely acidic and if it is 13, it means
that the substance is extremely alkaline. And when you opt for alkaline
drinking water, its pH level is greater than that of normal drinking water.
Thus, it is believed to neutralize the acid present in your body.</p>



<p>While
normal drinking water’s pH is approximately 7, alkaline water has a pH of 8 to
9. But pH is not the only beneficial factor. Alkaline water also contains
minerals and negative oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which is believed to
be excellent for your health.</p>



<p><strong>So, does it really work?</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-179" srcset="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-600x300.jpg 600w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6-194x98.jpg 194w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although
there is no scientific evidence yet, there are a few studies that show that
alkaline water is good for you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22844861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a study conducted in 2012</a>, it was seen that drinking carbonated artesian-well
alkaline water of pH 8.8 can get rid of pepsin, which is a culprit that causes
acid reflux.</p>



<p>And,
according to another study, it was shown that consuming alkaline ionized water
has immense benefits for people suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure,
and high cholesterol. Also, it was shown that drinking alkaline water ensures
the efficient flow of blood.</p>



<p>However,
there is no scientific evidence yet. But, cumulative results via various
studies make us believe that alkaline water provides several other benefits,
which include;</p>



<ul><li>Anti-aging</li><li>Colon-cleansing</li><li>Hydrated skin</li><li>Good skin health</li><li>Detoxifying properties</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Cancer resistance</li></ul>



<p><strong>Where can you get it?</strong></p>

<p>Today,
alkaline water bottles are available everywhere. However, the easiest way is to
buy a water purifier that provides this beneficial water. Vyom Alkaline Water
Ionizer is one such purifier. With the help of electrolysis, it separates the
water components into acidic and alkaline, raising the pH of the water. This
water ionizer is multifunctional and can be used in various ways. So, if you
are looking to enhance your health by just drinking water, you now know
alkaline water is the way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You have probably seen people talking about
Hydrogen water these days. Even the glossy lifestyle magazines are filled with
all the reasons why you must follow this trend, enticing you with shots of Zac
Effron and Blake Lively sipping on the fancy hydrogen-infused water. But before
you jump on the bandwagon, let’s find out if the hype is actually worth it or
if it is merely a useless fad.</p>



<p>So, what exactly is hydrogen water?&nbsp; Similar to the concept of carbonated water,
here hydrogen gas (H2) is infused with regular water to make it much more
beneficial and healthier. </p>



<p>According to theories and studies, when you
add hydrogen to your water, it makes it rich in antioxidants, which in turn
helps reduce the oxidative stress present in your blood vessels. To prove
hydrogen water beneficial, a study was conducted with 20 patients, suffering
from metabolic syndrome. And, for 10 weeks straight, they consumed hydrogen
water.&nbsp; </p>



<p>After 10 weeks, it was seen that their
total cholesterol and LDL or bad cholesterol levels had gone down, while the
good cholesterol or HDL had improved substantially. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-1024x512.jpg" alt="pexels-photo-327090.jpeg" class="wp-image-184" srcset="https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-600x300.jpg 600w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5-194x98.jpg 194w, https://www.vyominnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b5.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But one question that generally plagues us
when we see a new trend is if it is safe. The answer is hydrogen water is
completely safe because hydrogen is not a foreign substance. In fact, when we
consume fiber-rich meal, the bacteria present in our gut produces ounces of
this very substance every day. </p>



<p>And it is believed that consuming hydrogen
water is an excellent way to keep you healthy and vibrant looking. The top
benefits include;</p>



<ul><li>Reduces fatigue </li><li>Boosts energy </li><li>It acts as a remedy for several
allergies</li><li>Enhances cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular health</li><li>Helps prevent cancer and aids
its treatments</li><li>Helps control diabetes </li><li>Anti-inflammatory </li><li>Helps prevent degenerative
diseases</li><li>Helps slow down the ageing
process</li><li>Aids weight loss</li><li>Improves memory function</li></ul>



<p>While the rest of the world is still
hesitant in embracing this trend, Japan has been a step ahead of us all this
time. The hydrogen water market is going strong since the 1960s and almost 10
percent of the bottled water in Japan is infused with hydrogen goodness. In
fact, they have even started using hydrogen water for medicinal purposes and
skincare. </p>

<p>We have all heard this
a plethora of times that breathing&nbsp;<strong>clean air</strong>&nbsp;is exceptionally
important to our health. But, what exactly is clean air? Does it mean
pollution-free air? Basically,&nbsp;<strong>clean air</strong>&nbsp;means air that is
free of harmful pollutants, which includes chemicals, airborne microbes, dust,
and dirt.</p>



<p>On an average, we
breathe about 20,000 liters of air every single day. Now, the pollutants
present in the air are not visible to the naked eye and they tend to float
through the atmosphere. So, when you breathe in, especially in today’s toxic
environment, you also inhale the lethal particles. And, that’s immensely
harmful for you.</p>



<p>The toxic particles
enter our lungs through the nasal canal, causing various health issues. Some of
the common conditions include;</p>



<p><strong>Lung Problems</strong></p>



<p>When you live in metro
cities, air pollution is inevitable and even dangerous, especially for the
elderly and children. It can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and more.</p>



<p><strong>Lung Cancer</strong></p>



<p>Lung cancer is not
limited to smokers only. According to new evidence disclosed by All India
Institute of Medical Sciences, indoor pollution is ten times worse than outdoor
pollution. It causes almost 2 million premature deaths per year where the
statistics show that 44 percent are caused by pneumonia, 54 percent is due to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 2 percent is caused by lung
cancer. Right from the pollutants present in the air to the adhesive used on
the furniture, cancer causing elements are present inside your house.</p>



<p><strong>Cardiovascular
Problems</strong></p>

harmful and impure air for long, it increases your risk of heart diseases.

<p>Impure air might not
always lead to a disease. However, it can negatively impact your overall
health. Some studies show that living in metro cities, such as Delhi, Mumbai
can reduce almost three years from your life-span.</p>



<p>Now that you know,
why&nbsp;<strong>clean air&nbsp;</strong>is important? You must probably be wondering
what you can do about it? Fret not! It’s actually quite easy.</p>

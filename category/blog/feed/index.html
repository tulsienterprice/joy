										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The outbreak of coronavirus has forced countries to go on lockdown. This restricted people to stay at home, and then, the progress that the climate showed is worth mentioning. As we are celebrating <strong>World Environment Day</strong>, let’s shift our focus on all the positive impacts that this pandemic has offered to nature. There is no denying that this chaos has a vast effect on the human race, but needless to say, nature has bounced back.</p>



<p>Now, people are able to observe the clear, blue sky; the release of CO2 has decreased; the air around us which was toxic to breathe is now safe to inhale, the Himalayan Mountain Range is clearly visible for first time in almost 30 years from the Indian state of Punjab, the Ozone layer is healing itself, and many such facts have flooded our notification bar in the past few months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what’s the reason behind it? We believe less pollution.</p>



<p>The major impact which our environment faces is rising temperature, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels, which happen majorly due to the carbon emission caused by fuel-run vehicles.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Well, you can play your part safely. Choose a thrilling ride that won’t cost nature.</p>



<h3><strong>Switch to Electric Vehicles</strong></h3>



<p>Electric bikes can become one of the solutions to help our nature survive. <strong>Joy e-bike</strong> presents you zero-emission vehicles that won’t cost our planet. You can choose from our 8+ electric bikes and take a step ahead in contributing to the well-being of our planet in style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are looking forward to joining the bandwagon, then you would like to go through Joy e-bike’s vehicles in India 2020:</p>

<h3><strong>Electric Vehicles &#8211; A Boon To Nature</strong></h3>



<p>There are a plethora of benefits of e-bikes over conventional petrol/diesel vehicles.</p>



<p>Let’s check out some.</p>



<h4><strong>No More Harmful Emissions</strong></h4>



<p>When you prefer to ride an electric vehicle, you are choosing to reduce the release of carbon footprint. As compared to other conventional vehicles that run on fuels, e-bikes run differently. E-bikes are considered as zero-emission vehicles that use batteries to run and prevent the release of harmful emissions.</p>



<h4><strong>Use of Renewable Energy</strong></h4>



<p>The batteries of e-bikes can be recharged by the use of renewable energy. It is as simple as charging your smartphones. Plug-in, switch on, and leave. The next day you are ready to use it. By using renewable energy to recharge your electric vehicles (EV), the greenhouse gas emissions are reduced even further. Also, solar photovoltaic systems and Green Power will work great to recharge.</p>



<h4><strong>Long-Lasting Batteries</strong></h4>



<p>The batteries used in e-bikes are similar to the one used in cars and are easily replaceable and disposable. These batteries are lithium-ion, which does not contain lead. Hence, it does not harm the environment. Using batteries to enjoy a thrilling ride will produce little waste, last long, and are replaced after many years.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Less Damage to Roadways</strong></h4>



<p>Electric bikes are lighter in weight than other heavy means of transportations like buses, trucks, etc. As a result, it saves roadways from the damages. Whenever heavy vehicles damage the roads, the high emissions machines are used to repair it, which adds on to the pollution, and can harm the environment. Hence, by using electric vehicles (EV), you will help in reducing such damages.</p>



<h3><strong>Electric Vehicles encourages savings</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Cheaper to Maintain</strong></h4>



<p>Joy e-bikes are affordable electric scooters that are perfect for day to day use with very little maintenance. Electric vehicles run on battery. Hence, it has less moving parts, which reduces your maintenance cost. You will pay for little servicing. No money will be spent to repair radiators, silencers, motors, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>Cheaper to Run</strong></h4>



<p>Half of the citizens&#8217; concerns are about the rising prices of petrol and diesel. Why not ditch this concern forever? Riding <a href="https://www.joyebike.com/"><strong>electric two-wheelers</strong></a> are best and affordable for your pockets. Like Joy e-Bike E-Monster goes up to 100 km on a single charge and costs you just 25 paise per km. If needed, you can use handy calculators available on the internet to calculate your savings.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>The Cherry on The Cake</strong></h4>



<p>As EV owners, some other savings that will fall in your favor is that you are exempted from paying on registration or any kind of stamp-duty. No license, No registration, and Eco-friendly, what else would you call good news?</p>



<p>The high-performance model Joy e-bike E-Monster was one of the much awaited in our series. The bike requires all the required documents as it is as good as any fuel powered bikes in the market.</p>



<p><em><strong>Joy e-bikes are our “Solution to Pollution”</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you have been following the news without a break, you must have probably seen that the vital ozone layer is finally healing itself. A Nilgai was spotted in one of the busiest localities in Noida, casually strolling on the road. We even saw the endangered Kozhikode, leisurely taking the roads. Although the Coronavirus outbreak is petrifying, there is a silver lining to it and we can see a drastic shift in air pollution. The whole world is basically getting better as each day passes.</p>



<p>The reason behind this is because we humans are under lockdown. This means, factories, schools and a plethora of other organizations are shut. Streets are devoid of vehicles. And, this pandemic has allowed Earth to rejuvenate itself.</p>



<p>But is this all temporary? Not necessarily. If we humans are capable of causing the damage, we can make sure we rectify it too by reducing the air pollution. So, if you have thought about getting your hands on an e-bike, now is the right time. Why we say so? Keep reading to know more.</p>



<p><strong>Walking Long Distances Is Difficult</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4503" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-2.jpg 775w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-2-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-2-768x520.jpg 768w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-2-65x45.jpg 65w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></figure>



<p>Currently, you are required to <strong>stay at home to stay safe</strong>, but eventually, you will have to bring home the essentials and walking long distances is not as easy as it sounds. Of course, you can rely on your old bike. But, why not go electric? E-bikes are not only useful during the pandemic, but they can also help you make a difference from your side. Eventually, things will get back to normal and then, instead of aiding pollution, rectify it. Even one person can make a difference.</p>



<p><strong>Maintain D I S T A N C E</strong></p>



<p>One of the precautions we must take during the <strong>Corona outbreak </strong>is the social distance, and when you travel via bike, you get to do that. Of course, this is only useful if you ride alone. And traveling by bike is easier. You can even carry it in your car when required and it requires very little parking space.</p>



<p><strong>The Best Form Of Exercise</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4504" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-3.jpg 775w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-3-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-3-768x520.jpg 768w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/b6-3-65x45.jpg 65w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></figure>



<p>Staying at home means less exercise, but with an <strong><a href="https://www.joyebike.com/product/rockefeller/">e-bike</a>,</strong> you will get the required amount of exercise and you will also feel the wind in your hair and the sunshine caress your skin, helping you release all the stress gathered by staying at home. But again, social distancing is mandatory and take all the precautions while stepping out.</p>



<p>You can also use your e-bike as a mode of transport for short commutes once the pandemic ends. E-bikes come with fitted batteries and they will assist you by providing power to ensure a smooth ride. You can also choose to pedal when it is time to exercise.</p>



<p>Finally, when it comes to e-bikes, there are no stern traffic rules and you don’t need a license. If you are a good cycler then that’s the only qualification required. Also, with an e-bike, you will never get stuck in the pesky traffic and will avoid the unnecessary stress that comes along with it. If you are looking for e-bikes and also <strong><a href="https://www.joyebike.com/product/monster-bike/">electric two-wheelers</a></strong>, you can check Joy e-bike &#8211; <a href="https://joyebike.com"><strong>https://joyebike.com</strong></a> .

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There
is no denying climate change. And it’s high time we start doing something about
it with the urgency it deserves.</p>



<p>It
is unfortunate that most of us are still unaware of how global warming is
affecting us. While some believe it will pass with time, there are some who
believe individual efforts will do no good. Amidst the debates and arguments,
we are merely forgetting the pressing issue.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Save-our-Planet.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4293" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Save-our-Planet.png 272w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Save-our-Planet-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" /></figure></div>



<p>So,
what really is climate change? Also known as global warming, it is the rise of
the average surface temperature on Earth. Today, because of this severe
phenomenon, we are experiencing rising temperatures, longer wildfire seasons,
mosquitoes expanding their territories, bleaching of coral reefs, melting of
the ice in Antarctic, and more.</p>



<p>Now the
question we must ask is what we can do. Instead of waiting for someone else to
take action, it is on us to start working towards protecting our planet.
Because whether you like it or not, we only have one Earth.</p>



<h4>1. E-Bikes:</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Electric-bicycles-—-Joy-ebike.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4294"/></figure></div>



<p>The traditional bicycles are a great mode of transport,
especially when it comes to reducing your carbon footprint. However, they are
not suitable for longer commutes and that’s where e-bikes are super useful.
E-bikes come with an electric motor to help generate power assisting the rider
to pedal without much difficulty. This is one of the reasons why&nbsp;<a href="https://joyebike.com/our-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>electric
bicycles in Pune</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>are
gaining more and more popularity as e-bikes not only aid green initiative, but
they also help you cycle easily, while keeping you fit.</p>



<h4>2. Practice Sustainability:</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Practice-Sustainability.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-4295" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Practice-Sustainability.jpeg 400w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Practice-Sustainability-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div>



<p>The
first rule here is, make sure you reduce the consumption of the natural
resources. Second, always reuse. And finally, practice recycling. Right from
clothes to newspapers, everything can be recycled.</p>



<h4>3. Energy Saving</h4>



<p>When
it comes to energy saving, even small things matter. For instance, always
switch off the lights or fan when not in use, try to buy energy efficient
appliances and overall, consume as less electricity as possible. Why? Just
because you have it doesn’t mean you waste it!<strong></strong></p>



<h4>4. Learn</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Learn.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4296" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Learn.png 439w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Learn-300x201.png 300w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Learn-65x45.png 65w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure></div>



<p>Understand climate change and educate yourself on how
you can make a substantial impact. Once you think you have gained enough
knowledge, make sure you educate others about this problem. This helps spread
awareness, which is undoubtedly the first step in fighting climate change.</p>



<h4>5.
Shared Mobility</h4>



<p>Have you noticed? Every morning, cars and two-wheelers
swarm near the schools. These vehicles generally belong to parents who are
dropping off their kids. Now, only if schools make the use of school vans or
buses compulsory, then just imagine the positive impact it can have on climate
change.</p>



<p>And, that’s not all, is it? Every morning, most of us
also make use of two-wheelers or cars to get to work and it hampers our
eco-system. However, to make sure we get to work on time and also reduce the
carbon footprint, we can either use public transport or opt for carpooling.</p>



<h4>6.
Electric Vehicles</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Electric-two-wheelers-in-Pune-Joy-ebike.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4297" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Electric-two-wheelers-in-Pune-Joy-ebike.png 483w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Electric-two-wheelers-in-Pune-Joy-ebike-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://joyebike.com/product/monster-bike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Electric
two-wheelers in Pune</strong></a>&nbsp;are an exceptional way for you to reduce your
carbon footprint. These vehicles generally produce low or no carbon emissions,
which makes our environment happy. And also, unlike yesteryear&#8217;s, today you
will find powerful green vehicles. For instance,&nbsp;<strong>Joy ebike&nbsp;</strong>manufactures stylish range of e-bikes,
which is convenient and also comes with a plethora of benefits. Therefore, if
you are planning on investing on a vehicle, look for e-vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who doesn’t want a healthy body? After all,
a fit body equals a sane mind. Now, it’s not like we are unaware of the fact
the regular exercise comes with a plethora of benefits, it’s just that most of
us don’t prioritize it enough. And, one of the main reasons why we neglect
exercising is ‘time’. After spending a hectic day at work or school, mustering
up enough energy to hit the gym or go on a run sounds like a mammoth task. But,
there is a way out my friend, and we are talking about electric bikes. </p>



<p>Today, electric bikes in Pune<strong> </strong>are gaining a lot of momentum because of the profuse amounts of benefits attached to them.&nbsp; It operates just like a regular bicycle but with electric components attached to them to augment the power you put. This is immensely useful when you have to cycle through obstacles like hills or travel a long distance. </p>



<p>You are now probably wondering; why not opt
for a regular bicycle instead of an electric version. And the reason behind
this is the power it exerts. This means, you won’t tire easily and will also
give your body the exercise it deserves. You can even take your e-bike to work
or school and use it as a means of transport without any difficulty and finish
the quota of exercise that you are supposed to do. Keep reading to know more
about a few health benefits you can enjoy with the help of an electric bike. </p>



<h4>Healthy Heart </h4>



<p>When you start biking, your leg muscles are
put to work. And to keep it going, they need oxygen ,and fresh blood to
transport it to them. So, your heart works harder to get the task done, which
is great because it makes your heart strong and fitter. </p>



<p>In fact, according to a research from University of Glasgow, regular biking can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and even cancer. This is one of the major reasons why <strong><a href="https://joyebike.com/our-products/">electric bikes in Pune</a></strong> are gaining popularity because more and more people are jumping on the fitness bandwagon, which is indubitably important. </p>



<h4>Mental Well-being</h4>



<p>Yes, physical
health is extremely important but mental health is also as vital and most of us
don’t realize it early on. And what better than exercise to enhance your mental
well-being? But instead of exercising in the gym or your home, all cooped up,
taking a ride on your bike, with wind in your hair, feels good.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Basically, what happens is when you exercise,
endorphins get released and you start feeling euphoric. And it also releases
dopamine, which is commonly known as the happy hormone and it is one of the
reasons why working out even a little makes you feel better mentally, reduces
your stress and rejuvenates&nbsp; you. </p>



<h4>Strong Lungs</h4>



<p>Did you know?
According to a study conducted by Healthy Air Campaign, it was seen that
cyclists experience almost five times less pollution than compared to vehicles
run by traditional fuel. When you opt for a cycle, you get past all the
pollution and don’t inhale a large portion of it. So, owing to this, several
people are embracing the healthy lifestyle and opting for <strong>electric bikes</strong> <strong>in India</strong>,
such as the Joy-e-bike, who are the manufacturers of both e-bikes and electric
two-wheelers. </p>



<p>Also, when you
cycle, your lungs inflate and deflate at a faster pace, meaning,&nbsp; you start taking in more oxygen. Although
your ribcage limits the expansion of your lungs, it can increase by 15 percent

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Electric scooters are revolutionary. They
are not only extremely inexpensive (yes, they will help you save a ton of
money!), but they also make a positive impact on the environment. However, even
today, we all have numerous questions when it comes to electric vehicles and
when they aren’t answered, we simply stick to the traditional gasoline-run
vehicles because that’s something we have known all our lives. But, don’t you
think it is high time we change that? Today, we answer all your questions,
right here. Take a look at everything you must know about electric
scooters.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>How
fast can an electric scooter go?</h4>



<p>As fast as you want. Yup. Just like a
traditional petrol-run scooter, you are the one who controls the speed. Just
because it is electric, it doesn’t mean it can’t go fast. </p>



<h4>How
long does it take to charge electric vehicles?</h4>



<p>The exact time depends on the brand and the
model. For instance, Wolf Bike’s (Joy-e-bikes) charging time with a normal
charger is 3.5 hours and with a fast charger is 2.5 hours. And, when your bike
is completely charged, it can go up to 70 km approximately. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-2-1024x683-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4287" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-2-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-2-1024x683-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-2-1024x683-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Wolf Bike</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Are
electric vehicles efficient? </h4>



<p>Electric vehicles are as efficient as
fuel-run vehicles if not more. It is important for us to get out of this
misconception that electric vehicles don’t perform as well as traditional
vehicles. &nbsp;In fact, most electric
vehicles are almost 90 percent efficient, when it comes to converting energy
into motion. Therefore, you can actually depend on them. </p>



<h4>How
much does it cost?</h4>



<p>Now here comes the most exciting part. It’s
just 21 paise per km. No, it’s not a typo. It really costs merely 21 paise per
km. When was the last time you bought something within a rupee? Probably never!
</p>



<h4>How
long will the batteries last?</h4>



<p>It depends on the type of battery you use.
For instance, lead-acid batteries, the ones you find in gas-run vehicles, they
might not even make it a whole year. However, lithium-iron-phosphate batteries
are excellent and can last more than ten years. Therefore, always check with
the vehicle maker about the type of battery he is using to ensure quality. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-3-1024x683-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4288" srcset="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-3-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-3-1024x683-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-image-3-1024x683-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Glob Bike</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Are
electric vehicles safe?</h4>



<p>Yes. To enter the market, any vehicle must
meet all the government standards. So, don’t worry, your safety isn’t
compromised. </p>



<h4>Why electric
vehicles are expensive when compared to traditional vehicles?</h4>



<p>Electric vehicles are expensive mainly
because of the batteries. But remember, it is a one-time charge. You end up
saving money on fuel and let’s not forget, you are doing the environment a huge
favor. So in the end, it’s worth it, isn’t it?</p>



<h4>If I
am planning a long drive, is it possible? </h4>



<p>Yes, you can always carry an extra battery
with you. It’s very simple. </p>



<h4>Is
it true that electric bikes don’t require much maintenance?</h4>



<p>Yes. Electric vehicles don’t require oil
changes, exhaust systems and more. Therefore, fewer break downs and less
maintenance. </p>

<h4>How
do I charge my vehicle?</h4>



<p>It is very easy. Just plug in your vehicle to the available charging points. To know more, you can always speak to our customer service executive : <a href="tel:1800120055500">1800120055500</a>. </p>



<h4>How
do I set up a charging point in my garage?</h4>



<p>This is also very easy. When you buy the
vehicle, you can talk to the dealer regarding this and they will install a
charging point wherever it is convenient for you. </p>



<h4>Will
it overcharge?</h4>



<p>No. Once it is fully charged, our vehicles
will stop charging. </p>



<p>Hope this answers all your queries.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>“Building an empire from the scratch might seem adventurous in a book, but making it possible is not a walk in the park” &#8211; Yatin [&#8230;]</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Building an empire from the scratch might seem adventurous in a book, but making it possible is not a walk in the park”</em></p><p> &#8211; <strong>Yatin Gupte</strong>, CEO Ward Wizard Solutions Pvt Ltd. </p></blockquote>



<p class="text-justify">How
do you define an enemy? Most of you might be having different perspectives of what
an enemy is or who an enemy is. Maybe it might be someone from work, someone
from school, or maybe even that crazy dog that barks at you across the street.</p>



<p class="text-justify">When
World of Ward Wizard kick-started, the first thing it did was to define its
enemy. For us, it was a common enemy,&nbsp;<strong>POLLUTION</strong>. Mindless
consumption, rapid industrialization, and fast urbanization has evidently
created a more dangerous situation which will soon turn to be an epidemic of
Environment Degradation due to rising high pollution levels. With pollution
increasing at an alarming rate, it was time for us humans to step forward and
come up with a solution. This is where Ward Wizard comes in the picture.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>



<p class="text-justify">Wardwizard
Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. is an innovative thought, revolutionary ideation and
an extremely potent and viable concept-all executed with the utmost skill,
innate talent, and effortless sincerity. What we saw was not a business
opportunity, but a dire need for survival. This is when we came with our first
innovative thought.&nbsp;<strong>TECHNOLOGY.&nbsp;</strong>Since, today’s world
is more on the technology-driven side, taking the help of technology to prevent
the common issue didn’t seem off. We came up with our first line of products
under the name&nbsp;<strong>VYOM Innovations</strong>. Just like the name
suggests, the Sky is Only The Limit for the brand. Right from air purifiers to
eco-friendly refrigerators, Vyom rose up as India’s own Eco-Friendly tech
brand. Our most loved products are LED TVs, car air purifiers, room air
purifiers, refrigerators, wall-mount ACs, portable ACs, alkaline water
purifiers, raga products, and our latest addition to the pack, the android TVs.</p>



<p class="text-justify">What
makes Vyom the best of both the world is the cutting-edge technology and
pocket-friendly price. As mentioned above, we found a need and acted accordingly.
Our refrigerators are one of a kind. We are the only manufacturer in India that
manufactures refrigerators with In-door glass display, with quick-freeze
technology. Our Alkaline water purifiers are the best in the market when it
comes down to quality and price range.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="text-justify">With
the introduction of&nbsp;<strong>Vyom</strong>&nbsp;and its positive response
in the market, we found out that merging technology while taking care of the
environment is the new thing. This is how&nbsp;<strong>Joy-E Bikes&nbsp;</strong>formed.
Heading out to the automobile sector right from a tech background was indeed
difficult and was challenging. Well, when there’s always a challenge, we the
Ward Wizard always knew how to stand still even if the soil below was drifting
away. And that is what exactly we did. The automobile market is filled up with
giant names who have proven their worth and quality. So, competing with them
felt like an adrenaline rush and at the same time intimidating. The electric
bike segment was something most of these giants were looking forward to and
tried and failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="text-justify">Automotive
Emission is one of the biggest cause of Environmental Degradation, hence by
decongesting the cities, not concentrating around fewer cities and spread
across more regions, giving more work from home options where ever possible,
increasing availability of data bandwidth can encourage more video interactions
hence lesser travel, putting more emphasis on Pedestrian Walkways, Shared
Mobility using EV, MRTS can be lot of initiatives towards decreasing the carbon
footprint for a cleaner environment. Not only developing smart cities but
creating smarter villages can help toward reducing the carbon footprint. So,
now it was time to define our enemy again.&nbsp;<strong>Sustainable Mobility</strong></p>



<p class="text-justify">We
set up a team of professionals and market researchers and analysts to study the
market deeply. We found out that there is an immense need to reduce the cost of
the daily commute and this is what we could do with our bikes too. Can you
believe that we developed a machine that would cost you&nbsp;<strong>21
paise/km</strong>? Not just one product, a line of products that are becoming
more efficient as we speak.&nbsp;<strong>Joy-E Bikes</strong>&nbsp;rose to fame
in no time and became the next huge thing. We are the only manufacturer in
India with&nbsp;<strong>8+ models of electric vehicles.</strong>&nbsp;The bike
categories range from bicycles to performance bikes. Our recent addition to the
quiver is the&nbsp;<strong>MONSTER</strong>&nbsp;bike, where with just 4 hours
of charge you can cover 75kms. This is our&nbsp;<em>“Solution to Pollution”</em>&nbsp;and
every customer of ours is making the world a cleaner place to live in with
every commute.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="text-justify">With
50+ channel partners, 100+ professionals and 300+ executives working, both Vyom
and Joy-E Bikes gained popularity and became one amongst the Electric Vehicle
manufacturer giants. This created the idea of WWW or World Of Ward Wizard. The
concept was to bring in all the products of ours at a single place. “<strong>A
Hub To The Future</strong>”. While making and nurturing eco-friendly devices
and machines, Ward Wizard made sure to be the helping hand of more than 10+
entrepreneurship. This is when we understood why the company was formed. The
real moto of the company was now clear. While growing to heights, Ward Wizard
made sure to give a platform to these startups to grow. We sat down for the
board meeting with all the decision-makers and came to the same page where in
the next 10 years, we will be providing&nbsp;<strong>55,000+ startups with
unique ideas a platform to grow and flourish</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="text-justify">Ward
Wizard Solutions are aiming high and working hard to redefine the milestones.
We are inclined to technology as well as to a cleaner environment. In this
technology-driven world, we are trying our hands in AI, cloud technology,
database management, digital marketing, and software development. The picture
is huge, but it’ll never be as big as our vision. Join the gang!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="text-justify">We
the&nbsp;<em>Homo Sapiens</em>&nbsp;have been continuously evolving at a steady
rate since inception. One thing that we learned about our species is that there
is no stopping us from improving and improvising. From carving wheels from
stones to collecting stones from our neighboring planets, human beings have
emerged as the apex being that is living on the Earth’s surface.</p>



<p class="text-justify">What
is it that makes humans top of the food chain or rather we could say the rulers
of planet Earth? What is it that we have and the other species don’t have?</p>



<p>Challenges!
Yes. Challenges are what brings out the best in humans.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;“<em>Man doesn’t know what he is capable of until he is asked.”</em></strong></p>



<p class="text-justify">The
more challenges he faces, the better he performs. In this society running after
urbanization, challenges aren’t uncommon. With the evolved or modernized world
the level of challenges and threats also grew. One such inevitable challenge
that is being faced by modern human beings is the need for sustainable mobility.
Sustainable mobility is one of the greatest environmental challenges we face
today. Creating solutions that ensure the vital flow of people, goods, and
services while mitigating climate change is something automobile brands across
the world are working on. India is one of the fastest-growing markets for
automobiles due to its high population ratio and growing businesses. Toping the
list of the fastest developing nations, India is also amongst the list of the
countries where pollution is growing at an alarming rate. While the government
is taking necessary steps to reduce the grey smokey skies clouding over the
cities, brands like Joy-E target in creating and successfully executing a more
efficient way of countering pollution by introducing modes of sustainable
mobility in the Indian market.</p>



<p class="text-justify">What
makes Joy-E bikes stand apart from the other competitors is the technology and
unique designs they have. The Lithium-Ion batteries used in the vehicles are of
top quality and manufactured right here in the country. Being the face of the
&#8220;solution to pollution&#8221;, Joy-E is the only brand in India with more
than 7 unique models of electric vehicles. From bicycles to racing motorcycles,
Joy-E Bikes got them all. Making your commute affordable is what Joy-E is
promoting while providing a solution to the inevitable environmental challenge
the world is facing.</p>



<p><em>“<strong>Who says the journey has to end once you’ve reached your destination?”</strong></em></p>



<p>&nbsp;Decide
your commute after you’ve reached your destination with Joy-E bikes.</p>
